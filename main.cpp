You'll stay in a newly-renovated historic catholic schoolhouse with huge windows, designer details and an incredible rooftop view. You'll be a few minutes walk from McCarren Park, McGolrick park, tons of amazing restaurants and bars, and the L train and G train. Steps away from both charming Greenpoint and hip Williamsburg. Everything you need is within walking distance. Mostly a very quiet, relaxed neighborhood. The space is bright with large windows, lots of plants, and farmhouse chic designer details.
